Meeting Description:
   Discussion on Operations and Control Networks (OCNs)

More Information:
   High-precision network operations are critical for Automation in different verticals. We would like to 
   (1) explore and assess the community interest. 
   (2) Discuss control systems related use cases and talk about challenges where IETF scoped protocol can come handy. 
   (3) Talk a bout a generic model which is technology-agnostic and walk through what kind of interfaces and message types 
   will make sense.
