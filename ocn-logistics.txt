Meeting Description:
   Discussion on Operations and Control Networks (OCNs)

More Information:
   High-precision network operations are critical for automation in different verticals. We would like to 
     (1) explore standardization operatunities in control system and assess the community interest in this work
     (2) Discuss control systems related use cases and talk about challenges where IETF scoped protocol can come handy. 
     (3) Talk a bout a generic model which is technology-agnostic and walk through what kind of interfaces and message types 
         will make sense.
